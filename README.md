# Cristina Garcia Portfolio
I created this web application portfolio. The goals of this project are:
- Showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.
- An effective portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.
- Create an online presence of my work.
Having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

## User Story
```
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples SO THAT I can review samples of their
work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
